This electronic notebook provides the scripts employed to analyze _Stylophora pistillata_ gene expression dynamics across shallow (5 m) and mesophotic (45 m) reefs under ambient (8.2 pH), intermediate-low (7.8 pH), and low (7.6 pH) pH conditions. This analysis characterizes the transcriptomic response of adult _S. pistillata_ colonies from the Red Sea to predicted future ocean acidification conditions.
